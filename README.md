# Standard Atmosphere Analyser
This mini project is based on the chapter 'Standard Atmosphere' I had learnt in my Aircraft Performance course during my graduation.

A detailed report is in progress! Please check back in a few days, or drop in an email to show interest and get notified whenever I release the report.

Meanwhile if you are interested, you can use the python script 'atmosphere.py' to calculate theoretical atmospheric parameters within an altitude range of 0 km to 105 km. The program in itself is intended to be intuitive to use. You can also explore the executable file 'atmos.exe' which is a Python Tkinter GUI application based on 'atmosphere.py' module

For any queries or suggestions, please feel free to contact me through Email or LinkedIn. You can find the contact information on my Github profile.
