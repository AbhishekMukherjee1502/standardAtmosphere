# Standard Atmosphere Analyser
This mini project is based on the chapter 'Standard Atmosphere' I had learnt in my Aircraft Performance course during my graduation.

## Introduction
For any aerospace design project, it's crucial to know the conditions your vehicle will face during its operation. This essentially means having a good knowledge of the temperature, pressure, and density of the air it will be dealing with. These parameters are key players in how your aircraft will perform and handle different situations. Understanding the atmosphere helps engineers and designers create a vehicle that not only works well but can handle the challenges posed by the surrounding air. It's like laying the foundation for a building â€“ get the basics right, and you set yourself up for a solid and effective aerospace design.

The International Standard Atmosphere is an atmospheric model maintained by International Standards Organization (ISO). Refer to the document 'ISO 2533-1975' to know more.

Side Note: If you are working on a model aircraft or model rocket, calculating these atmospheric parameters may sound like an overkill when your vehicle is mostly gonna operate at altitudes less than 1000 metres (3280 feet) from the sea level. This claim comes from the fact that at 1 km from the sea-level, the changes in these parameters are minute and moreover, at these altitude, these paramters are mostly influenced by the human interventions at the ground.

### Temperature
$$T = T_0 + a(h - h_0) $$

### Pressure

### Density
