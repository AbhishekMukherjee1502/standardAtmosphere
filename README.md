# Standard Atmosphere Analyser
This mini project is based on the chapter 'Standard Atmosphere' I had learnt in my Aircraft Performance course during my graduation.

A detailed report is in progress, meanwhile if you are interested, you can use the python script 'atmosphere.py' to calculate theoretical atmospheric parameters within an altitude range of 0 km to 105 km. The program in itself is intended to be intuitive to use. 

For any queries or suggestions, please feel free to contact me through Email or LinkedIn. You can find the contact information on my Github profile.
